# Nodes-Vizu
 
## The goal of this algorithm is to build an arc diagram from a graph G with N nodes. 

the input of the algorithm is N nodes with all the relationships between the nodes represent an arc
![interface](input.jpeg)

the output is an arc diagram showing the relationships between the nodes

the goal is to bring each node closer to its neighbors, which is equivalent to minimizing the distance of each node from the barycenter of its neighbors.
